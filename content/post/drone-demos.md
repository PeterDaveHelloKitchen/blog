We had been looking to build a collection of Drone-related examples for some time, but preliminary results from our [user survey](/post/drone-user-survey/) indicated that this was something in need of more urgent attention. Many of you are eager to incorporate Drone into your workflows, but are unsure of how to best use Drone and your language of choice. We've heard your feedback, and have some early results to show!

## The drone-demos GitHub org

With the disclaimer that this is still preliminary and evolving every day, I'd like to direct your attention to the newly minted [drone-demos](https://github.com/drone-demos) GitHub organization. Within the cozy confines of this org, you will find a number of basic examples taking form. Perhaps you'll find some things that are already useful to you!

Our intent is to curate a library of examples of Drone doing different things. Drone running tests, Drone compiling packages, Drone publishing Docker images, Drone running automated deploys, Drone mowing the lawn. There are some exciting things being done with our growing [plugin catalog](http://readme.drone.io/plugins/) that we'd love to show off.

## Lend me your demos!

Now that we've unveiled [drone-demos](https://github.com/drone-demos), I'd like to send out a call for help. If you don't see your favorite language, framework, DB server, or Docker-related awesomeness represented, please consider submitting a demo repository. If you have ideas for improvements to any of the existing demos, we love pull requests.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, get a demo repo put together and post to the [Developer category](https://discuss.drone.io/c/development) of our [Discussion site](https://discuss.drone.io). We can assist in getting it moved over to drone-demos and announced on here (with your name attributed). If there's anything we can do to help with your demo, stop by our [drone-dev Gitter room](https://gitter.im/drone/drone-dev).

## Up next...

Over the following weeks, we'll highlight some of the demos as they round into form. Look for those to be posted here and announced by [@drone](https://twitter.com/droneio) on Twitter.
