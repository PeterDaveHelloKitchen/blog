Our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) room has served our small community well as it took root. As our userbase multiplied and the project picked up steam, we now find ourselves outgrowing Gitter as our primary (and only) means of interaction.

On any given day, a handful of new or potential users stop by with some excellent questions. We also have a robust crowd of existing users in the room (well over 700 at this point). In both cases, the users have to contend with the chatter of developers (and vice-versa). It's also a bit difficult to search for previously answered questions.

To improve the situation on all fronts, I am excited to announce the [Drone Discussion site](https://discuss.drone.io/). This is Drone's new home for community discussions, support, how-to's, and Plugin and API development, and more.

## How will things be different?

The quick summary:

* The [Gitter](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) room will shift to be more Drone developer-oriented. Discussions here will tend to be about improvements to Drone and its official plugins.
* For any development discussions that need input or review outside of anyone who may be in the Gitter room at the time, we'll post to the [Development](https://discuss.drone.io/c/development) category.
* Everything else will go on the the [Drone Discussion site](https://discuss.drone.io/):
  * Questions regarding the setup, operation, or administration of Drone should be directed to the [Help!](https://discuss.drone.io/c/help) category. All topics here are archived and searchable long-term, a major improvement over our Gitter room.
  * We now have some [language-specific categories](https://discuss.drone.io/c/plugins-and-apis) for using and developing our Plugin and HTTP APIs.   
  * We also have a [Tips, Tricks, and How-To's](https://discuss.drone.io/c/how-tos) category that will contain lots of examples and other goodies. Contributions welcome!
  * Rounding things out, there's a more general [User Discussion](https://discuss.drone.io/c/user-discussion) category for Drone-related chatter that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

## Say hello!

If you are willing and able to share, please stop by the [User Discussion](https://discuss.drone.io/c/user-discussion) category and introduce yourself. We'd love to hear how you are using Drone, and how things are going so far.
