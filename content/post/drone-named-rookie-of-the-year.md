Today, Black Duck Software [announced](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/open-source-rookies) their annual Open Source Rookie of the Year awards. Weâ€™re very excited that [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) was awarded honorable mention. This award recognizes the top new open source projects of the past year and really highlights the strength of the container ecosystem. Fellow recipients include [Kubernetes](https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/kubernetes), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) and [Fig](https://github.com/docker/fig). [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker) was an award winner last year.

Today's recognition is a reflection of the Drone community. This week we reached **100 contributors**. To date we've processed nearly **400 pull requests**. Drone is being used by startups, tech giants, and large corporations alike. This is a great way to kickoff what is sure to be an exciting year!

## About Drone

In short, Drone is a [continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) system built on top of [Docker](http://docker.io/).

Drone was created to eliminate the pain of setting up and maintaining testing infrastructure and test environments. It empowers developers to continuously test their product and automatically deliver with minimal effort. Simply pick a Docker image tailored to your needs, connect GitHub, and commit. That's it.

Drone uses Docker containers to provision isolated testing environments, giving every developer complete control over their stack without the burden of server administration. The community is 100 contributors strong and is poised to bring Drone to the enterprise and mobile app development.
