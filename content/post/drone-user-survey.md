2015 was an excellent year for Drone and our community. We saw over 150 developers contribute well north of a thousand commits to our projects. Adopters of Drone now range from early startups to international corporations. Our [plugin catalog](http://readme.drone.io/plugins/) has grown to rival that of most alternative CI systems. We are excited and encouraged, and hope you are as well!

With 2015's successes behind us, we'd like to pause long enough to gather some feedback from our users and developers. By doing so, we hope to better fit our roadmap to your needs. We're also working on making Drone a sustainable business as we continue to grow our open source projects.

## Your Input is Needed!

To help make this year as transformative as the last, we have put together a [user survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lwXPsKABEJPWxLBNxLDAXN0PMo--jpTD652N5QEjkNo/viewform). Your feedback will directly contribute towards setting our priorities for 2016 and beyond. Our questions range from upcoming feature prioritization to systems or services we can offer to make you happier and more productive. 
   
Once you have responded to the survey, we ask that you pass the link on to any other Drone users you may know. We take your input seriously, and would love to see the majority of our community represented! 

*Note that this survey is aimed at users of the open source [Drone project](https://github.com/drone/drone), not our hosted drone.io service*. Your responses and any identifying information you might provide will not be sold or shared.
