[Darren Coxall](https://github.com/dcoxall) has contributed a [Drone demo](http://blog.drone.io/post/drone-demos/) showing how to deploy Drone on [Amazon EC2 Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (ECS). For those running on Amazon Web Services, this is a convenient and relatively simple way to run Drone. 

Visit the [drone-on-ecs](https://github.com/drone-demos/drone-on-ecs) demo to see how it's done. Thanks, Darren!
